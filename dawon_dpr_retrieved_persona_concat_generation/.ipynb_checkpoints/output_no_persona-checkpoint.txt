speaker 2: i like mystery books!  how are your nephews doing? speaker 1: they are doing the best they possibly can. their school went back to remote learning in the fall, and poor helen is just at her wit's end. luckily, i live so close to her that i feel comfortable going over occasionally to help with cooking and make cookies and breads as snacks for the kids. my trick? i put veggies in the cookies! those little buggers don't even know they're eating healthy! speaker 2: that's a great idea!  i bet you'll have no problem finding a job as a chef!  when do you finish your classes? speaker 1: i've got about four weeks left. you know, going into cooking, you think it's going to be kind of hard and kind of fun, but then you realize, it's really hard and it's only fun when the food comes out right. but it's night and day from when i first started! what about you? any response yet from the library gig? speaker 2: that's good that you don't have much longer!  you should be proud of yourself for sticking with it!  i'm still finishing up my literature major in college. i've been doing some volunteer work at the school library.  i think i'll love when i can get paid to be in a library all day!  do your nephews like to read? speaker 1: i think you'll be the perfect fit. i know how challenging school can be, but it will definitely be worth it being surrounded by the thing you love! i think with them it's a love/hate relationship... by that i mean the love when they don't have to and hate when they do! hah! speaker 2: that's usually how it goes with kids!  i'm sure, just like cooking with the veggies, we can think of a way to sneak some books in and make reading less like a chore and more like a game! speaker 1: well if only i had the gift like you do. i don't know... it's always been hard for my family to get into reading. my parents didn't do much of reading to me growing up, so it never sparked my interest. i will say, i love reading a good cookbook! i could run through a couple of those in an afternoon. and i fully accept the weirdness of that. 
prediction: 
speaker 2: that's true!  i'm sure your family would love to
gt        : 
speaker 2: the way i see it, reading is reading!  i'm happy if people read anything at all!  even if it's just a cookbook!  it still gets the brain working!

speaker 2: i'm actually rethinking the idea. maybe i just don't want to be with this guy. speaker 1: if that's what you think is best for you. are you two living together, would you have to find a new place to live? speaker 2: luckily, we aren't living together. his family are super religious. they don't even know about me. speaker 1: that's a relief, it makes it easier to cut ties when you aren't living together. i can't believe he hasn't even told his family, how long have you guys been together? does he not think they would accept you or does he have other reasons? speaker 2: to be honest with you, all of the above. he's super scared of them. he never stands up for himself; they basically run his life. it's an argument we've had several times. i'm starting to think he's not the man i deserve. speaker 1: i'm sorry to hear that, that must be hard. i completely agree with you though, you deserve someone who is proud to show you to his family and friends. do you think you'll end things soon? speaker 2: yes. i think i'll do it tomorrow. speaker 1: how do you think he'll take it? maybe do it in a public place so he doesn't cause a scene.  speaker 2: we live a bit far from each other. i'll have to do it over the phone. he's not the scene-making type. it does hurt, though. he'll probably cry and say he can't lose me, but i can't do this anymore. speaker 1: i'm sorry to hear that, that's hard, for both of you. maybe this will be the wake up call that he needed, and maybe he will start standing up for himself. do you have friends close-by that can take you out and be a shoulder to cry on, if needed? 
prediction: 
speaker 2: yes, i have a few close friends that are super supportive.

speaker 2: i hate saying this, but this won't wake him up at all. it will only make him give up. i do have amazing friends. thanks so much for being so much help.
