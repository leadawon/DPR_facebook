speaker 2: living on the yacht has its challenges, but i love the peaceful mornings more than anything. is it peaceful in your area of the suburbs? speaker 1: it's pretty good. i like living near the city, but also somewhere that is not so congested. where have you traveled and stayed for a while while living on your yacht? speaker 2: we have stayed in this area by the catalina islands since we got married. we do like to travel though. we were in chicago about 6 months ago. there are a lot of things to see and i can understand wanting to live in the suburbs up there. you mentioned that you would like to get red hair, may i ask why you haven't colored it red? speaker 1: i am deciding yet if that is truly the color i want, and i am also deciding what shade of red i want. i am not totally sure i want to do a dark red. i think it might not suit my look. what do most of your people at the salon prefer? speaker 2: it all depends on your skin color. you are so right about there being a lot of shades of red. if you have a sylist that you trust, i would encourage you to see them and maybe get a temporary coloring speaker 1: that's a good idea. i didn't even think about trying a temporary color. do you work at a salon on catalina island or somewhere else? speaker 2: i get to work right on the shores of the island and i often get vacationers........ the fun thing about individuals on vacation is that they do things they may not normally do,, like get their hair colored...lol. do you ever get a chance to vacation away from the chicagoland area? speaker 1: yes, i like to travel whenever i am in the mood to get away and do something new. i travel somewhere new about every 2-3 months. i was just in sanibel, fl for a little winter getaway. it was wonderful. have you ever been (or "sailed" ) to sanibel, florida in your travels on the yacht?

speaker 2: well i just had the opportunity to read "ready plyer one" that was such a great book that combined so many amazing genres! speaker 1: that sounds awesome! i admit i've never read it myself; i love to read, but i am only reading cookbooks at the moment! i am vegan though, so my choice is limited speaker 2: i'm vegan as well. i've never really found good cookbooks though. i tend to order in food way too mcuh anyway. do you have any favorite receipes? speaker 1: my favourite is quorn sausages, because they are meat free, and (apparently) taste like real sausages! i've always loved animals, so couldn't stand eating them speaker 2: that sounds delicious! i think i need to try it. i know animals are just so amazing to be around and i've learned so much about them since starting vet school. i couldn't imagine how tortured they really feel being raised for food. speaker 1: yeah, that's right. i have 2 cats and a dog, and couldn't imagine them being hurt. vet school sounds fantastic! i'm currently still in school at the moment, but being a vet is one of my aspirations. why did you want to join vet school? speaker 2: i guess it just came from my love of animals. i wanted to learn as much as i could about how their bodies work and help them. so learning to be a vet just felt like the natural choice. speaker 1: that sounds cool. i'm just currently trying to read up on jobs, but find myself stuck on reading sci-fi and philosophy books. maybe i should become a philosopher or something! speaker 2: yeah the job search is so frustrating and easy to get sidetracked from. it's much easier to just start reading something fun. i can totally relate. but have you picked up any interesting books from it?  Speaker 1 enjoys reading science fiction and philosophy books

speaker 2: that is really cool.  i haven't watched much football, but i imagine you have a lot of fans! speaker 1: i used to but some of my fans are turning on me now because we just ended the season poorly. i might get traded soon...does your husband like football? speaker 2: yeah, he is a huge vikings fan... i usually just leave him to it.  that is weird that your fans would stop liking you just because you had a poor season.  do you think you have loyal fans that became fans when you were in college, and will follow you wherever you go? speaker 1: yea i have a few. they will always support me. my biggest fan is my wife. ooh i see, maybe one day he will be a fan of carson wentz haha. so you currently live in new york? speaker 2: no.  unfortunately i don't.  i live with my husband in minneapolis, but i work for 3m as a national sales manager, and i am constantly in new york trying to get our regional sales office to be more efficient, speaker 1: oh i see, so you get to travel for work. that must be fun! how long are your trips usually? i'm sure it can get exhausting at times too. speaker 2: my trips are usually monday through thursday.  i fly out early monday morning, and fly home early friday morning or late thursday night.  and to be hones, i don't totally enjoy the traveling aspect... but i love the job.  i am sure you can relate to that. speaker 1: what's the best part of the job for you then? that does sound daunting and i'm sure your husband misses you a lot. yea i can totally relate - lots of travelling and being away from home. my newborn misses his dad quite often. say, you should watch the eagles play sometimes. if we beat the vikings you can have bragging rights lol. speaker 2: the best part of the job for me is watching the new sales team members get to the point where they are no longer salesmen/women, they actually believe in the product and realize they don't need to be pushy or sneaky to sell.  many of them are fresh out of college and they just want money.  so watching them grow up is the best part for me.  you know... i would rather be a fan of yours than your team... so whether you stay in philly or if you get traded... i would be your loyal fan.  maybe you'd even hook us up with some amazing seats and totally blow my husbands mind when he sees the connections i have!  Speaker 1 is confident in his team's ability to make it to the playoffs.
